# Mecklenburg County Active Landfills Map
The purpose of this map is to show the audience the amount of landfills within Mecklenburg County, which houses the City of Charlotte, North Carolina.  Not only does this map show the amount of landfills within the county and surrounding counties, but it also shows how these active landfills are placed around the county.  If you look closely, you can see that many of the landfills are far outside the city where there is more land for this purpose.  The landfill points are marked by a small truck.  The point data from this project was gathered from NConemap.gov that shows all of the [active landfills in North Carolina](https://www.nconemap.gov/datasets/ncdenr::active-permitted-landfills?geometry=-61.780%2C21.840%2C57.048%2C46.844).  The other dataset was the [counties shapefile](https://www.nconemap.gov/datasets/NCDOT::ncdot-county-boundaries/data?geometry=-87.255%2C33.573%2C-72.402%2C36.717) from the NC One Map website.  Both of these datasets were converted to GeoJson files and imported into the code.
